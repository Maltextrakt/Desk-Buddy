## Description

"DeskBuddy" is an environment monitoring system to help people who sit and work. The system has two components: the Wio device that monitors the environment and notifies the user, and the Android app where users can define their optimal environment profiles and select their notifications.

The Wio device continuously monitors temperature, humidity, and light levels. These are displayed graphically at the desk of the user, and indicators change color according to user-defined preferences. The sensor data is sent to the Android app in real-time where they are displayed on the home page, and stored in a database from which users can obtain and plot historical measurements.

The Wio device also periodically notifies the user that they have been sitting too long and that they need to stand up and stretch. Users can continue working and monitoring their environment after pressing a button. The device also displays one-time or periodic user-defined notifications, as well as motivational messages, which can be defined or customized in the Android app by the user.

Through environmental monitoring, motivational messaging, and user defined notifications, DeskBuddy allows users to work smarter, stay hydrated, and get regular physical movement.
